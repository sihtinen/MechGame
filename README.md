# Untitled Mech Game
Personal game project - a 3rd person mech action game made with Unity 2022.3

Currently building a vertical slice of the game where all core game systems are in an MVP state.
All visual assets are pure placeholders and there for game systems development purposes only.

Inspirations include the original Armored Core games, Ace Combat series, the tactics games from Mimimi Games and more.

Footage of the progress so far:
