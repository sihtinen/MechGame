# Untitled Mech Game
Personal game project - a 3rd person mech action game made with Unity 2022.3

!!! Project currently freezed due to incoming changes to Unity Engine licencing terms. I'm evaluating and choosing my next main game engine at the moment. I plan on porting this project there after I've chosen an engine that is worth investing time into.

Currently building a vertical slice of the game where all core game systems are in an MVP state.
All visual assets are pure placeholders and there for game systems development purposes only.

Inspirations include the original Armored Core games, Ace Combat series, the tactics games from Mimimi Games and more.
